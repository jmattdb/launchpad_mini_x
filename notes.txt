About channels when using faders:

Documentation mentions two channels for faders in DAW
- Channel 5, Control Changes: B4h (180): DAW Fader position sets.
- Channel 6, Control Changes: B5h (181): DAW Fader colour sets.

Experimenting with midi.py I found that when sending DAW to LP:
- CH 5 will change the fader color only
- CH 6 will change the fader value.

So in theory, we want Ableton to do as follows:
- DAW should use CH 6 for updating LP value
- DAW should use CH 5 for color update
- LP should send CH 5 for volume update

Current issue is that DAW->LP changes colors but not the bar
values, while LP->DAW actually does change the volume. Note that while 
doing this, the colors also change, which suggests that DAW sends updates 
to LP as well.

Measuring current channel activity in Ableton confirms:
- Entering volume mode, DAW->LP uses CH 6 to set color on all 8 LP faders. WRONG!
- Modifying fader on LP, LP->DAW uses CH 5, and right after, DAW->LP sends
  an update using CH 5 (which changes LP color). WRONG!
- Modifying fader in Ableton, DAW->LP uses CH 5 (which changes LP color only). WRONG!
